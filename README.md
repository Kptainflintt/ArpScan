# ArpScan
Scanning network with UDP request and ARP

Thanks to @mdjx for his base script

The purpose of this script (currently in v0.2) is to scan network for hosts using UDP and ARP cache in order not to miss guests not responding to the ping

Provide 2 choices :

1. Scanning an range manually
2. Scanning according to NIC (and netmask attached to it)

!!!WARNING!!! For english users, you MUST change "dynamique" to "dynamic" at line 78
