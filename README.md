# ArpScan
Scanning network with UDP request and ARP

Thanks to @mdjx for is base script

The purpose of this script (currently in v0.1) is to scan network for hosts using UDP and ARP cache in order not to miss guests not responding to the ping

Actually, you can scan network directly attached to NIC

In the future, I will add possibilty to provide a range manually.

!!!WARNING!!! For english users, you MUST change "dynamique" to "dynamic" at line 78
